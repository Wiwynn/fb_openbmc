/*! This interface provides access to a JTAG controller.  
 *
 * It defines methods to perform JTAG shifts, to enable/disable the JTAG connection,
 * and to report on the status of the JTAG connection.  If an implementation contains
 * more than one JTAG controller, there should be an instance of a class implementing
 * this interface for each controller.  Any "behind the scenes" work needed for a JTAG
 * controller must be implemented in the class(es) implementing this interface.  
 * For example, if more than one "virtual" JTAG controller (each with their own object 
 * implementing this class) share a single hardware TAP controller, the low-level 
 * implementations of the controllers must handle the mux switching (or equivalent)
 * necessary to grant the associated virtual TAP control of the hardware, as well as the
 * signalling between different TAPs to preserve state across switches.
 * 
 * It is vital for JTAG HAL implementations to get the sequencing correct.  Single-bit
 * granularity is required in the pre-TCK, data, and post-TCK phases.  The pre-/post-TCK
 * clocks must occur within the same TAP state machine sequence as the main data transfer;
 * i.e. the pre-TCK clocks occur in RTI before transitioning to Select-DR-Scan, and the
 * post-TCK clocks occur in RTI after exiting Update-DR or Update-IR.  This is depicted in
 * the following diming diagram:
 * 
 * \image html shift_timing.png
 * \image latex shift_timing.eps
 * 
 * Note that this timing diagram shows an even duty cycle clock, which is not necessary in 
 * the implementation.  What is important is the location of the TCK edges with respect
 * to the sequencing of the TAP state machine, which is controlled by TMS.
 * 
 * This class includes some optional extensions, which are defined in their own
 * classes (prefixed with \a IJtag_).  If the hardware implements any of those
 * optional extensions, the associated interfaces must also be implemented by the class
 * implementing \a IJtag.
 *
